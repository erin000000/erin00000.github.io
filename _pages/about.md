I'm a forth year undergraduate student from [Soochow University](https://www.suda.edu.cn/). My research interest includes immunology, microbiology and machine learning.
I am very fortunate to be accredited by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University [School of Medicine] (https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/) to pursue my studies in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology. 
You can find my CV here: [Qu Yang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
